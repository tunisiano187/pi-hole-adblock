This project will be used to create a list for pi-hole that has most of the spam, scam, ... addresses

That list will be updated automatically and you will be able to add it to your own instance of Pi-hole.

We will use other lists and merge them, and add exceptions.

The exceptions will create their own lists to be able to choose if you want them or not.

## Current lists imported
